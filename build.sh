Usage: ./build.sh [command] [args]

Everyday commands:
  build              build (Debug) -- what runs with no command at all
  run                build, quit any running copy, and relaunch it
  test               run the unit tests
  path               print the path of the built .app
  stop               quit a running instance
  clean              delete build products

Release commands, in the order a release actually goes out:
  version [x.y.z]    show the current version, or bump to a new one
  dmg                build Release, sign it, and package
                     build/Snippad-<version>.dmg, plus the matching
                     build/Snippad-<version>-debug-symbols.zip that
                     crash reports are read with
  notarize           submit that .dmg to Apple and staple the ticket
  publish            create the GitHub release for <version> with the .dmg
                     and the debug symbols, once it has checked the .dmg is
                     notarized, no older than the source it was built from,
                     and that the symbols belong to the app inside it

  release            a bare Release-configuration build, for trying one
                     locally -- unsigned, no .dmg. Packaging one to ship
                     is 'dmg', not this.

Environment variables:
  CONFIG             Debug or Release; build/run/clean read it, default Debug
  NOTARY_PROFILE     the notarytool keychain profile to submit under,
                     default Snippad
